// libraryEntries.js — Reference library entries for LER ecosystem specifications.
// WHY THIS SCHEMA EXISTS: The metadata fields were designed to serve three goals:
// 1) Human discovery (filters, tags, labels a person can scan)
// 2) AI/analytics discovery (structured fields a system can query programmatically)
// 3) Implementation readiness signaling (burden, capabilities, equity, privacy)
//
// Fields map to the EDU Reference Library spec:
// - implementationBurden: helps implementers triage what they can adopt now vs. later
// - requiredCapabilities: prevents adopting something you lack infrastructure for
// - equityConsiderations: surfaces LIF-derived accessibility flags
// - privacyConsiderations: flags FERPA, COPPA, or data sensitivity issues
// - accessLevel: open vs. restricted (Gates Foundation openness principle)
